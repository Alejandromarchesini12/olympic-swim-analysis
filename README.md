# Olympic Swimming Performance Analysis (1972–2024) 🏊‍♂️

This project explores how Olympic swimmers have performed relative to world records over the last 50+ years, focusing on 100m events for all strokes and genders.

## 📊 Dashboard
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:**  
  [Swimming performance (OLY-WR) on Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/alejandro.marchesini/viz/TableauProject-SwimmingperformanceOLY-WR/OlympicSwimmingPerformanceAnalysisof100mEvents19722024)

## 📁 Files
- `Olympic_Swimming_Results.xlsx` — Cleaned Olympic swimming results dataset
- `World_Records_Progression_100s.xlsx` — Cleaned world records progression dataset for 100m events
- `Swimming_performance_OLY-WR.twbx` — Tableau workbook

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Combined Olympic results and world record data for 100m events (1972–2024)
- Created a custom metric: **% Behind World Record** to normalize the performance gap
- Designed an interactive dashboard to explore:
  - Which Olympics had the most world record breakers
  - How world records have progressed by stroke and gender
  - How close gold medalists were to breaking the WR in each Games

## 📝 Key Insights
- Only about 5.4% of Olympic swims beat the standing world record.
- The gap between Olympic winners and world records has fluctuated, with notable improvements in some years (e.g., Beijing 2008).
- Advancements in training, technology, and technique have driven performance changes.
